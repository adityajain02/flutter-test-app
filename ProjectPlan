Hi,

I'm creating this repository to  document and ideate on how to be a better, self-sustained, polymath and polyglot developer. And maybe use the skills to do something good for the world.

I will update my ideas and will link all ideas here so that one day it looks like a giant masterpiece.

First, starting with an app. I want to make a small app using flutter. Hence, will start with making the app on my personal laptop. Will update to github once it has something substantial. In process, I will learn git, github, flutter and dart, the language on which flutter is developed.

See you soon!
